## Important Notes

### Before Running
- ‚úÖ Ensure you're logged into Pinterest in Chrome
- ‚úÖ Close all Chrome windows before running the script
- ‚úÖ Verify ChromeDriver is installed and accessible
- ‚úÖ Check that the board URL is accessible

### URL Requirements
- Must start with `https://ru.pinterest.com/`
- Must be a public board or one you have access to
- Should be a board URL, not a pin URL

### Performance
- The script includes delays to be respectful to Pinterest's servers
- Download speed depends on your internet connection and board size
- Large boards may take several minutes to process

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"ChromeDriver not found"**
   ```bash
   brew install chromedriver
   ```

2. **Login redirects**
   - Make sure Chrome is closed before running
   - Verify you're logged into Pinterest in your regular Chrome

3. **No images found**

   - Ensure the board is public or you have access
   - Try running with `headless=False` to see what's happening

4. **Permission errors**
   ```bash
   chmod +x pinterest_downloader.py
   ```
